    <h2>Cliopatria</h2>
    <p>
        Cliopatria is a comprehensive open-source geospatial dataset of worldwide states, political groups, events, and rulers from 3400BCE to 2024CE.
        It is part of the Seshat Global History Databank project and is used on the World Map and polity pages.
        Cliopatria comprises over 1800 political entities sampled at varying timesteps and spatial scales. Many, but not all of these are linked to Seshat's polity pages, which provide detailed information on each polity.
        Released versions may be accessed on <a href="https://github.com/Seshat-Global-History-Databank/cliopatria"class="fw-bold">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/13363121" class="fw-bold">Zenodo</a>.

        While we strive to reflect the most current historical knowledge, we acknowledge that these maps reflect only one version of the territory held by past polities.
        Border uncertainties, as well as differing opinions on the names, territorial changes, and durations of polities, are common challenges facing historians.
        We welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement. Following <a href="https://seshatdatabank.info/methods/world-sample-30">standard Seshat protocol</a>, any reported errors will be addressed after expert historian review.
