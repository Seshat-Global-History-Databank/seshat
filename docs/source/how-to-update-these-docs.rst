When and why to update these docs
---------------------------------

The main purpose of these docs are to ensure that the methods and processes of researchers and developers are well documented and easy to follow, which is helpful for both new and existing team members.

You should update these docs if:

- You have particular method, process or way of working that you'd like to share with the team (or be able to repeat yourself in the future).
- You have noticed that a particular section of the docs is out of date, incorrect or has important details missing.

How to request an update to these docs

Choose the "Documentation Improvement" issue template and provide as much detail as possible about the update you'd like to make.

Once the issue is created, you may wish to add a specific person under the "Assignees" section, or leave it blank if you're happy for anyone to pick it up.
