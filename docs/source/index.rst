Project Documentation
---------------------

The Seshat Global History Databank website can be found at `Seshat DB <https://seshat-db.com/>`_. Seshat has a user login system, with different levels of access depending on the user's role.

On this site you will find documentation for the Seshat project, such as how-to guides and technical guidance applicable to those working on, or contributing to Seshat.

The documentation is divided into sections based on the role of the reader, which match the access level of your account on the Seshat website. These roles are defined as follows:

1. Seshat Databank Admin: A member of the Seshat team responsible for the maintenance and development of the Seshat codebase.
2. Research Assistant: A researcher using and/or contributing to the Seshat data as part of an ongoing Seshat affiliated project.
3. Seshat Expert: A historian with the necessary expertise and permission to approve or reject changes to the Seshat data.
4. Public User: A historian or other interested party who has created an account on the Seshat website to suggest data edits.
