**How To Set Up Django with Postgres, Nginx, and Gunicorn on an Ubuntu 22.04 (AWS EC2 Instance)**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Introduction:**

Django, a robust web framework, accelerates the development of Python applications and websites. While the built-in development server is suitable for local testing, any production-related endeavors demand a more secure and potent web server. This tutorial guides you through the installation and configuration of essential components on Ubuntu 22.04 to bolster the support and seamless serving of Django applications. We will also be setting up a PostgreSQL database on the same server instead of using the default SQLite database. We will configure the Gunicorn application server to interface with our Django application. We will then set up Nginx to reverse proxy to Gunicorn, giving us access to its security and performance features to serve our apps.

**Prerequisites and Goals**

In order to complete this guide, we should have a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 server instance with a basic firewall. This can be any EC2 instance with Ubuntu 22.04 as the Operating System. We will be installing Django within a virtual environment on the above-mentioned server (or Virtual Machine). Installing Django into an environment specific to our project will allow our project and its requirements to be handled separately.

Once we have both our Postgres database and Django application up and running on the same server, we will install and configure the Gunicorn application server. This will serve as an interface to our application, translating client requests from HTTP to Python calls that our Django application can process. We will then set up Nginx in front of Gunicorn to take advantage of its high performance connection handling mechanisms and its easy-to-implement security features.

Setting Up AWS EC2 Instance for Seshat Backup Server
----------------------------------------------------

In this tutorial, we work with an AWS EC2 instance as the server. Using the AWS Management Console or any preferred method, it is straightforward to create an EC2 instance. Please note that for optimal compatibility, we recommend using Ubuntu 22 as the operating system. How much processing power and memory to choose is totally optional for the purpose of this tutorial. As a hint, the website has been functional in the past two+ years on a t2.micro server.

+------------+--------+----------------------+
| Instance   | vCPU   | Memory (GiB)         |
+------------+--------+----------------------+
| t2.nano    | 1      | 0.5                  |
+------------+--------+----------------------+
| t2.micro   | 1      | 1                    |
+------------+--------+----------------------+
| t2.small   | 1      | 2                    |
+------------+--------+----------------------+
| t2.medium  | 2      | 4                    |
+------------+--------+----------------------+
| t2.large   | 2      | 8                    |
+------------+--------+----------------------+
| t2.xlarge  | 4      | 16                   |
+------------+--------+----------------------+
| t2.2xlarge | 8      | 32                   |
+------------+--------+----------------------+

1. **Creation of AWS EC2 Instance:**
    - Navigate to the AWS Management Console and follow the straightforward instructions to create an EC2 instance.
    - Ensure you choose a proper RSA key-pair during the setup process. Safely store the key-pair file on your local machine. In this tutorial, we refer to the key-pair file as **seshat-backup-server-kp.pem**.
2. **Operating System Compatibility:**
    - To avoid potential compatibility issues, it is recommended to use Ubuntu 22 as the operating system for your EC2 instance.
3. **Status Check Verification:**
    - Monitor the EC2 dashboard until the "Status Checks" indicate a status of "2/2 checks passed." This ensures that the EC2 instance has successfully passed both system and instance status checks.

Upon AWS EC2 instance creation, make sure you open the firewalls to **inbound** IPV4 and IPV6 traffic, as well as SSH, HTTP and HTTPS ports. This can easily be done through adding security group rules:

+------+---------+------+-----------+-------------+
| IPv4 | All TCP | TCP  | 0 - 65535 | 0.0.0.0/0   |
+------+---------+------+-----------+-------------+
| IPv6 | All TCP | TCP  | 0 - 65535 | ::/0        |
+------+---------+------+-----------+-------------+
| IPv4 | HTTP    | TCP  | 80        | 0.0.0.0/0   |
+------+---------+------+-----------+-------------+
| IPv4 | HTTPS   | TCP  | 443       | 0.0.0.0/0   |
+------+---------+------+-----------+-------------+
| IPv4 | SSH     | TCP  | 22        | 0.0.0.0/0   |
+------+---------+------+-----------+-------------+

And the outbound rules:

+------+-------------+------+------+-----------+
| IPv4 | All traffic | All  | All  | 0.0.0.0/0 |
+------+-------------+------+------+-----------+

By following these detailed instructions, you not only ensure a secure setup of your AWS EC2 instance but also pave the way for a hassle-free experience with the Seshat Backup Server.

We need to keep track of two things from the AWS EC2 server:

- **the public ip address**: 16.171.40.111
- **Public IPV4 DNS**: ec2-16-171-40-111.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com

In the AWS EC2 dashboard, go to **connect** tab and select **SSH client**, you will see something like this that you can run locally to connect to the AWS EC2 instance:

.. code-block:: bash

    ssh -i "seshat-backup-server-kp.pem" ubuntu@ec2-16-171-40-111.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com

This is how you can connect to the server from your local machine from the folder where you have saved the file "seshat-backup-server-kp.pem". You might need to add sudo before the command to make it work. Pretty straightforward. Also, say yes if asked whether you want to add the server address to the list of known hosts.

After connecting to our AWS EC2 server via SSH, you will get a terminal command line that is the terminal of the AWS EC2 Instance you just created, it might look something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    ubuntu@ip-172-31-41-211:

Go on and create a folder that will be dedicated to host everything related to the project:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir seshatprojecthome
    cd seshatprojecthome

First things first, we need to get the latest packages from Ubuntu:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-venv python3-dev libpq-dev postgresql postgresql-contrib nginx curl

Bringing in the Codebase
------------------------

Make sure you know where the codebase lies on GitHub and from inside **seshatprojecthome** directory, do a git clone (if git is not installed on the server you might have to install it):

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/MajidBenam/seshat.git

Among the files brought in via the **git clone** command, there is an important file called: requirements.txt, which includes all the more specific packages and libraries we need for our Django project to run properly. But before that, we need to start a virtual environment specific to the Django project and make sure that we install everything in there. We do so inside the seshatprojecthome directory, where the seshat folder also resides:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m venv seshatprojectenv

Before installing our project’s Python requirements (requirements.txt), we will need to activate the virtual environment. We can do so by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

    source ~/seshatprojecthome/seshatprojectenv/bin/activate

The new prompt will look something like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    (seshatprojectenv)user@host:~/seshatprojecthome$

With our virtual environment active, we install the packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    (seshatprojectenv) $ sudo apt install build-essential
    (seshatprojectenv) $ pip install -r /home/ubuntu/seshatprojecthome/seshat/requirements.txt
    (seshatprojectenv) $ pip install django gunicorn psycopg2-binary

.. note::

    We have such a thing in the running new backup requirements.txt, but it is probably not important:

    backports.zoneinfo==0.2.1;python_version<"3.9"

    In any case, if you get an error like:

    × Building wheel for backports.zoneinfo (pyproject.toml) did not run successfully.

    Ignore it. It ‘s not gonna cause any problems.

    Make sure that psycopg and django-heroku are installed properly.

Preparing the Database Arrival
-------------------------------

With codebase and its necessary packages taken care of, we start the database side of the job. We type the following command in the AWS EC2’s terminal to log into an interactive Postgres session (as the default user: postgres):

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo -u postgres psql

If we did not have a database .dump file, we had to create one from scratch, but now we just need to use scp on our local machine to transfer the .dump file that we have saved locally to the AWS server:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo scp -i /home/majid/dev/AWS/seshat-backup-server-kp.pem -r aws_pg_backups/backup_Jan_8.dump ubuntu@ec2-16-171-40-111.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com:seshatprojecthome/

We need to change the password for user postgres (the root user of our postges service):

.. code-block:: bash

    ubuntu@ip-172-31-19-221:~$ sudo su postgres
    postgres@ip-172-31-19-211:/home/ubuntu$ psql
    postgres=# ALTER USER postgres password 'mypassword';

To quit psql and exit postgres user:

.. code-block:: bash

    postgres=#\q
    postgres@ip-172-31-19-211:/home/ubuntu$ exit # or (CTRL + D)

Before we can fully get started with Postgres, we need to change the Postgres authentication settings in the AWS server. Go to the folder containing the postgres installation files and settings:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /etc/postgresql/14/main/

There are two files in the above directory we need to change slightly. One is the pg_hba.conf file. Open the file using sudo vim:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo vim pg_hba.conf

Inside pg_hba.conf, modify the following line and save the file.

.. code-block:: none

    # Database administrative login by Unix domain socket
    host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0             md5
    local   all             postgres                                md5

The second file here is postgresql.conf. Open the file:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo vim postgresql.conf

and find the following line:

.. code-block:: none

    listen_addresses='localhost'

Enable (uncomment) the above line and replace the **'localhost'** with **'*'**. Save the file.

As we have changed some major settings, we need to restart the postgresql service in the AWS server terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo service postgresql restart

We should then create an empty database (as user: **postgres**) before we connect it to the .dump file (which has already been transferred to the AWS server) and have a functional database serving our Django application. We do the following inside the AWS server terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    createdb -U postgres seshat_pg_db

And then:

.. code-block:: bash

    pg_restore -U postgres -d seshat_pg_db /home/ubuntu/seshatprojecthome/backup_Jan_8.dump

The SQL database is now ready and can be accessed from the AWS server terminal. Make sure it is the case by:

.. code-block:: bash

    ubuntu@ip-172-31-19-221:~$ sudo -i -u postgres
    postgres@ip-172-31-19-211:/home/ubuntu$ psql
    \c seshat_pg_db
    postgres=# select id, name, new_name from core_polity;

Exit the database:

.. code-block:: bash

    \q
    exit # or (Ctrl+D)

Merging the Codebase and the database
-------------------------------------

With both the codebase and the database housed on the same AWS server, we are ready to introduce them to each other and deploy the web server for everybody to see on the web. First we need to make sure that the main Django settings file (**settings/base.py**) gets the correct credentials to use the postgres database (**seshat_pg_db**) as its main database. Introduce the database to the Django settings/base.py:

.. code-block:: python

    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost',  'xx.xxx.xx.xxx',]

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': '****',
            'USER': '******',
            'PASSWORD': '*******',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '5432',
        }
    }

To create the .env file in the same directory as the manage.py file: (/home/ubuntu/seshatprojecthome/seshat), do:

.. code-block:: bash

    vim .env

The content of the .env file should look something like this:

.. code-block:: none

    DB_NAME = "seshat_pg_db"
    DB_USER = "postgres"
    DB_PASSWORD = "mypassword"  # the not mypassword one.
    DB_HOST = "localhost"
    DB_PORT = 5432

    SECRET_KEY = 'django-insecure-g&ax*@qz6hcsmf)-&k75gm=)^cx33vm%t6pslid+*v$v7bw6@2'

    EMAIL_FROM_USER = 'seshatdb@gmail.com'
    EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'seshatdb@gmail.com'
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = '5tr4%TR$6zt5&ZT%'

    GOOGLE_APP_CLIENT_ID = '77017415274-u1f5efvo1ubkmp1uqc4h7otic27d5qmc.apps.googleusercontent.com'
    GOOGLE_APP_SECRET_KEY = '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'

    ZOTERO_API_KEY = 'u25OofjR8CUPr9RI99LEZW17'
    # For future use
    EMAIL_APP_PASS = "jfbgdlwrmpkysnsn"

We now need to ask Django to bring all the static files of the project (CSS files, images, etc.) together. Inside the virtual environment and in the same path as manage.py:

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py collectstatic

Everything seems to be in place to test the server using Django local server:

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

Now you should be able to see the website through your browser on: http://PUBLIC_IP_OF_AWS_SERVER:8000

.. note::

    make sure you use **http** and (**not https**), even if the browser automatically changes the url to the https version)

This is serving the website, but this way of serving the website is not reliable in production. So, lets go on.

Testing Gunicorn’s ability to serve our Project
-----------------------------------------------

Gunicorn is usually installed as a Python package within the virtual environment, and its executable is available in the bin directory. The last thing you need to do before leaving your virtual environment is test Gunicorn to make sure that it can serve the Django application. You can do this by entering the project directory and using gunicorn to load the project’s WSGI module:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/seshatprojecthome

.. note::

    You might need to do (sudo ufw allow 8000) to open the 8000 port, if you have not taken care of the firewalls (security groups) properly.

.. code-block:: bash

    gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 seshat.wsgi

You can go back and test the app again in your browser. Is it working? So far, so good.

We are now finished configuring our Django application. We can back out of our virtual environment by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

    deactivate

We have tested that Gunicorn can interact with our Django application, but we should now implement a more robust way of starting and stopping the application server. To accomplish this, we’ll make systemd service and socket files.

Start by creating and opening a systemd socket file for Gunicorn with sudo privileges:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.socket

Inside the **gunicorn.socket** file, write this:

.. code-block:: none

    [Unit]
    Description=gunicorn socket

    [Socket]
    ListenStream=/run/gunicorn.sock

    [Install]
    WantedBy=sockets.target

Next, create and open a systemd service file for Gunicorn with sudo privileges in your text editor. The service filename should match the socket filename with the exception of the extension:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service

Inside the **gunicorn.service** file, write this:

.. code-block:: none

    [Unit]
    Description=gunicorn daemon
    Requires=gunicorn.socket
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    User=ubuntu
    Group=www-data
    WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/seshatprojecthome/seshat
    ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/seshatprojecthome/seshatprojectenv/bin/gunicorn \
                    --access-logfile - \
                    --workers 3 \
                    --bind unix:/run/gunicorn.sock \
                    seshat.wsgi:application

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

You can now start and enable the Gunicorn socket. This will create the socket file at **/run/gunicorn.sock** now and at boot. When a connection is made to that socket, systemd will automatically start the **gunicorn.service** to handle it:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo systemctl start gunicorn.socket
    sudo systemctl enable gunicorn.socket

You can confirm that the operation was successful by checking for the status socket file:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo systemctl status gunicorn.socket

Next, check for the existence of the gunicorn.sock (do not confuse it with gunicorn.socket) file within the /run directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    file /run/gunicorn.sock

If there is any problem, check the Gunicorn socket’s logs by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo journalctl -u gunicorn.socket

**Testing socket activation:**

Currently, if you’ve only started the **gunicorn.socket** unit, the **gunicorn.service** will **not** be active yet since the socket has not yet received any connections.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo systemctl status gunicorn

To test the socket activation mechanism, you can send a connection to the socket through curl by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl --unix-socket /run/gunicorn.sock localhost

You should receive the HTML output from your application in the terminal. This indicates that Gunicorn was started and was able to serve your Django application. You can verify that the Gunicorn service is now running by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo systemctl status gunicorn

If there are any issues, check them on:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo journalctl -u gunicorn

If you make changes to the **/etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service** file, you should reload the daemon to reread the service definition and restart the Gunicorn process by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart gunicorn

Make sure you have no issues before continuing.

---

**Configure Nginx to Proxy Pass to Gunicorn**

Now that Gunicorn is set up, you need to configure Nginx to pass traffic to the process. Start by creating and opening a new server block in Nginx’s sites-available directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/seshat

The content of the seshat file should look like this:

.. code-block:: nginx

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name **xx.xxx.xxx.xx**;

        location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }

        location / {
            include proxy_params;
            proxy_pass http://unix:/run/gunicorn.sock;
        }

        location /static/ {
            autoindex on;
            alias **/home/ubuntu/seshatprojecthome/seshat/seshat/staticfiles**/;
        }
    }

We are almost done. While here, we change the content of nginx config to make sure that it can access all the files in our project:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

On the top of the file, the user should be changed from **www-data** to **root**:

.. code-block:: nginx

    user root;

Save and close the file when you are finished. Now, you can enable the seshat file and enable the website, by linking it to the sites-enabled directory. The purpose of creating a symbolic link is to enable or activate a specific site configuration. In Nginx, having the configuration file in the **`sites-available`** directory doesn't automatically make it active. By creating a symbolic link to the **`sites-enabled`** directory, we effectively tell Nginx to consider this configuration file when it starts or reloads its configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/seshat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled

Test your Nginx configuration for syntax errors by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo nginx -t

If no errors are reported, go ahead and restart Nginx by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo systemctl restart nginx

You should now be able to go to your server’s domain or IP address (without the :8000 or other ports at the end and with http instead of https) to view your fully functioning application.
