Azure cloud setup with Pulumi
=============================

.. note::

    This guide on how to run a full setup of the Seshat django app on Azure with Pulumi based on `this guide <https://www.pulumi.com/docs/clouds/azure/get-started/begin/>`_.

    It assumes that you have access to a Seshat database dump, including all the spatial data. You can access it through the project's `Google Drive <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c5djM48ve91t84Ug4a8JksSC0p4J-eav?usp=sharing>`_ if you have access to it.

    It assumes that you are located in the UK and have access to the Azure subscription that the Seshat project is under.

    It assumes that your data tables are populated with the shape data. If it is not, you can populate them with the instructions in `spatialdb.rst <../spatialdb.rst>`_.

.. warning::

    The setup is only partially automated with Pulumi currently. As you'll see below, subsequent steps are required to that involve SSH-ing into the created VM.


Prerequisites
-------------

The following instructions assume you have the following software installed:

- Python 3 (in order to use ``venv``)
- Pulumi
- Azure CLI

.. admonition:: Installation instructions for prerequisites
    :class: dropdown

    **Python 3**

    Ensure you have a working installation of Python 3. The application has been tested with Python **3.8.13**.

    If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from `Python's official website <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.

    **Pulumi**

    Ensure you have a working installation of Pulumi.

    .. hint::

        If you need to install Homebrew, you can find instructions on how to do so on `Homebrew's website <https://brew.sh/>`_.

    If you don't have Pulumi installed, follow the `documentation <https://www.pulumi.com/docs/install/>`_ e.g. on a Mac:

    .. code-block:: bash

        brew install pulumi/tap/pulumi

    **Azure CLI**

    Ensure you have a working installation of the Azure CLI.

    If you don't have the Azure CLI installed, you can download it from `Microsoft's official website <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli>`_.

Step 1: Log in to Azure
-----------------------

Ensure that you are correctly logged in and that the subscription you will use comes up in the list of subscriptions printed out, then set to that subscription:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ az login
    $ az account set --subscription "<subscription-id>"


Step 2: Create a virtual environment for Pulumi
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You can use either Conda or Python's built-in ``venv`` module to create a virtual environment (you could also re-use the environment you set up for Seshat development and install the requirements there).

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Conda example

      Create the environment:

      .. code-block:: bash

         $ conda create --name seshat_pulumi

      Activate the environment:

      .. code-block:: bash

         $ conda activate seshat_pulumi

   .. tab:: venv example

      Create the environment:

      .. code-block:: bash

         $ python3 -m venv seshat_pulumi

      Activate the environment:

      .. code-block:: bash

         $ source seshat_pulumi/bin/activate

Install the requirements:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r pulumi/requirements.txt

Step 3: Set up a Pulumi stack
------------------------------

We assume here that you'll use our provided Pulumi setup (located in the ``/pulumi`` directory in this repository).

.. admonition:: Setting up a Pulumi stack from scratch
    :class: dropdown

    If you're setting up a Pulumi stack from scratch, you can follow the below steps:

    1. Set up a Pulumi stack for Azure Python:
    
       .. code-block:: bash

          $ pulumi new azure-python

    2. Initialize a new Pulumi stack:

       .. code-block:: bash

          $ pulumi stack init <stack-name>

    3. Select the stack:

       .. code-block:: bash

          $ pulumi stack select <stack-name>

.. important::

   In the provided set up in the ``/pulumi`` directory, we have already set up the Pulumi stack for you.

   In the included set up, we:

   - Chose a sensible project name: `seshat-dev`
   - Chose the stack name `seshat`
   - Chose ``UKSouth`` location
   - Made custom edits to the config files for the Seshat app

To set up this Pulumi stack, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pulumi stack init seshat
    $ pulumi stack select seshat

Step 4: Configure Pulumi
------------------------

You will need to provide the following configuration values:

- ``sshPublicKey``: The public key that will be used to SSH into the VM. You can find your public key by running:

  .. code-block:sh

     $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

The following command will set the `sshPublicKey` configuration value:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pulumi config set --secret sshPublicKey "$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)"

..
    TODO: `privateKey` and `dumpFile` paths are needed for SCP command, which currently isn't working via Pulumi, see manual steps below

        $ pulumi config set privateKey "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
        $ pulumi config set dumpFile "/path/to/dumpfile.dump"


Step 5: Deploy the app
----------------------

To deploy the app, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pulumi up


Manual steps
------------

The Pulumi setup is only partially automated. The following steps are required to complete the setup:

- SSH into the created VM
- Set up the database
- Run the Django app

Manual step 1: SSH into the created VM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, we want to get the public IP address of the VM:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pulumi stack output

This will output the public IP address of the VM. Make a note of this IP address as you will need it to SSH into the VM.

In order to SSH into the VM, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa webadmin@<VM IP adress>


Manual step 2: Set up the database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once we've logged inot the VM, we need to set up the database. In this step, we create the database, add PostGIS to it, set a password for the superuser, update postgres to use md5, and restore the database from the dump.

To create the database, we need to open ``psql``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo -u postgres psql

Then, create the database:

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE DATABASE <seshat_db_name>;

Exit out of ``psql`` using ``\q``.

Next, we need to add PostGIS to the database by opening ``psql`` again using the correct user:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo -u postgres psql -d <seshat_db_name>

Then, add PostGIS to the database:

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE EXTENSION postgis;

Exit out of ``psql`` using ``\q``.

Manual step 3: Secure the database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choose a password for Postgres. At Turing we have an Azure Key Vault set up under the project subscription where this can be saved (the one we have set up can be reused).

In order to add the password for the superuser, open ``psql``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo -u postgres psql

Then, add the password for the superuser:

.. code-block:: sql

    ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD '<db_password>';

Update postgres to use md5:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo nano /etc/postgresql/16/main/pg_hba.conf

.. image:: ../../../img/pg_hba.conf.png

In order for the changes to take effect, reload postgres:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo systemctl reload postgresql

Exit out of ``psql`` using ``\q``.

Manual step 4: Restore the database from the dump
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. hint::

    This step assumes that you have access to the Seshat database dump.

    You can access it through the project's `Google Drive <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c5djM48ve91t84Ug4a8JksSC0p4J-eav?usp=sharing>`_.

In order to restore the database from the dump, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo psql -U postgres <seshat_db_name> < ~/seshat.dump

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[Optional] manual step 4.1: Update the database with the latest shape data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need to update the database with the latest shape datasets, you can do so by following the instructions in `spatialdb.rst <../spatialdb.rst>`_.

You can first upload the data files required to the VM using ``scp``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa path/to/datafile webadmin@<VM IP adress>:location_on_vm/datafile

Manual step 5: Collect static files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd seshat
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ python manage.py collectstatic

Manual step 6: Add the IP address to the allowed hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, open ``seshat/settings/local.py`` and add the created IP address to ``ALLOWED_HOSTS``.

.. code-block:: python

    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['<public IP>']

Then, ensure local (test site) settings are set:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=seshat.settings.local

Manual step 7: Set up Gunicorn and Nginx
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can test the app by running it with Gunicorn:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ gunicorn seshat.wsgi:application --config gunicorn.conf.py

Visiting the public IP address in your browser should now show the Seshat app on the port 8000: ``http://<public IP>:8000/``.

Kill the Gunicorn process with ``Ctrl+C``.

Create a systemd service for Gunicorn:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.socket

Inside the file, add the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    [Unit]
    Description=gunicorn socket

    [Socket]
    ListenStream=/run/gunicorn.sock

    [Install]
    WantedBy=sockets.target

Next, create a systemd service file for Gunicorn. The service filename should match the socket filename with the exception of the extension:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service

Inside the file, add the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    [Unit]
    Description=gunicorn daemon
    Requires=gunicorn.socket
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    User=webadmin
    Group=webadmin
    WorkingDirectory=/home/webadmin/seshat
    ExecStart=/home/webadmin/seshat/venv/bin/gunicorn \
              --access-logfile - \
              --workers 3 \
              --bind unix:/run/gunicorn.sock \
              seshat.wsgi:application --config gunicorn.conf.py

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target


You can now start and enable the Gunicorn socket.
This will create the socket file at `/run/gunicorn.sock`` now and at boot.
When a connection is made to that socket, systemd will automatically start the gunicorn.service to handle it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo systemctl start gunicorn.socket
    $ sudo systemctl enable gunicorn.socket

You can check the status of the Gunicorn socket and Gunicorn with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo systemctl status gunicorn.socket
    $ sudo systemctl status gunicorn


Next, we need to set up Nginx to pass web requests to the socket file:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/seshat

Add the following configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name <public IP>;

        location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }

        location / {
            include proxy_params;
            proxy_pass http://unix:/run/gunicorn.sock;
        }

        location /static/ {
            autoindex on;
            alias /home/webadmin/seshat/seshat/staticfiles/;
        }

    }

Change the content of nginx config to make sure that it can access all the files in our project:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

On the top of the file, the user should be changed from www-data to root:

.. code-block:: bash

    user root;

Then, link the file to the sites-enabled directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/seshat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled

Check the Nginx configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo nginx -t

If the test is successful, restart Nginx:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo systemctl restart nginx

You should now be able to access the Seshat app on the public IP address ``http://<public IP>/``.
