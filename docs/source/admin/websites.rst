Websites
=============

If you are a developer on the project, a table of website urls is maintained on the project's wiki: https://github.com/Seshat-Global-History-Databank/seshat/wiki/Seshat-sites

If you modify any of these websites, or deploy new one's with the Seshat codebase during development, please add them to the list on the wiki, and update the date of the last edit.
