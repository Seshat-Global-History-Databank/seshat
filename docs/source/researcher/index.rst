Researcher
============

These pages are useful for any researcher contributing to, or consuming, the Seshat data as part of an ongoing Seshat affiliated project.

A great place to start for someone new on the project is the `Getting started with Seshat data <getting_started>`_ page, which contains example notebooks for loading Seshat data in Python.

You may also wish to review the `team <../team.rst>`_ page, which includes a help section, to see who on the Seshat team can help you with various tasks.
