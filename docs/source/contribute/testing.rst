Testing
=======

Prerequisites
-------------

Activate your project python environment. Then install all the required test packages:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements/tests.txt

Running tests locally
---------------------

First, make sure the Seshat repo root directory is in your PYTHONPATH:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/seshat"

Then use the Django test interface to run tests for apps:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py test <app name> --keepdb

Replace ``<app name>`` with the app's full name (e.g. ``seshat.apps.core``) (or leave this setting entirely off to run all tests).

The ``--keepdb`` flag ensures you can rerun tests quickly if the setup hasn't changed.

CI
---

GitHub actions is set up to run on this repo. It uses a custom Docker image that gets built on every push or PR to ``dev`` if the Dockerfile has changed.

See ``.github/workflows`` and the ``Dockerfile``. The tests (``.github/workflows/tests.yml``) and any subsequently introduced workflows should always run on push/PR to ``dev``.

To set up pushing the docker image using the GH action workflow, I first did the following:

- Generated a new GitHub token with the ``read:packages`` and ``write:packages`` scopes. Under my ``Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens`` (classic token).
- Stored the GitHub token as a secret in the Seshat GitHub repository, ``Settings > Secrets``, named ``GH_TOKEN``.
