Software tools
==============

This section of the documentation provides information on some of the commonly used software tools used in the Seshat project.

If you are participating in a Seshat workshop, run these steps sequentially before the workshop to ensure you have the necessary tools installed on your computer.

Python & Anaconda
-----------------

On a Mac or Linux computer:
1. Python is installed on your computer by default.
2. Open Terminal and type `python --version` to check the version of Python you have installed.
    - Note: if you are not familiar with using the command line, you can find Terminal in the Applications folder on your Mac. Pin it to your dock for easy access.
3. We recommend installing `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_ a useful package manager for macOS and Linux.
    - Note: check if homebrew is already installed by typing `brew --version` in Terminal.
4. Install Anaconda via Homebrew by typing `brew install --cask anaconda` in Terminal.

On a Windows computer:
1. Install Anaconda with this `guide <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/>`_.
    - Note: to download the installer from the Anaconda website it will ask you to create an account.
2. Once installed, open the Anaconda command prompt and type `python --version` to check the version of Python you have installed.
    - Note: you can find the Anaconda command prompt in the Start menu on your Windows computer. Pin it to your taskbar for easy access.

Git & GitHub
------------

1. Create an account on `GitHub <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github>`_.
2. Ensure Git installed on your computer:
    - On a Mac or Linux computer, open Terminal and type `git --version` to check if Git is installed.
    - On a Windows computer, open the Anaconda command prompt and type `git --version` to check if Git is installed.
3. If Git is not installed already:
    - On a Mac or Linux computer, install Git via Homebrew by typing `brew install git` in Terminal.
    - On a Windows computer, install Git by typing `conda install -c conda-forge git` in the Anaconda command prompt.
